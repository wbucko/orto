## if you want to cache npm you can put the npm install here, but you have to remember, that this script runs in seperate container,
## so to maintain the "node_modules" folder you have to add it to the docker_volumes list
#npm install

#rake db:setup
#rake seed:setup
## this is similiar to npm, assets will precompile inside "run" container, but to "save" them you'll have to add the /app/public/assets to volume list
rake assets:precompile
